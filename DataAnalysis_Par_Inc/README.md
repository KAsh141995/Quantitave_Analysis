# Analysis for Par, Inc.

### Par, Inc., a prominent golf equipment manufacturer, is exploring opportunities to enhance its market share by introducing a more durable and cut-resistant golf ball. The research team at Par has been diligently working on a new coating for the golf ball to achieve this goal. While the tests with the coating have shown promising results, one researcher expressed concern about the potential impact on driving distances. Par aims for the new cut-resistant ball to maintain driving distances comparable to the current model to ensure seamless transition for users.

#### To address these concerns, I conducted an analysis covering the following:

- **Hypothesis Test Rationale** : Formulated and presented the rationale for a hypothesis test that Par could use to compare the driving distances of the current and new golf balls.

- **Data Analysis** : Analyzed the data from the distance tests involving 40 balls of both the new and current models. This analysis provided the hypothesis testing conclusion, including the p-value for the test.

- **Recommendation** : Based on the analysis, a recommendation was made for Par, Inc., considering the hypothesis test results.

- **Confidence Intervals** : Calculated the 95% confidence interval for the population mean driving distance of each model and the 95% confidence interval for the difference between the means of the two populations.

This comprehensive analysis aims to guide Par, Inc. in making informed decisions regarding the introduction of the new golf ball, ensuring that it meets the desired criteria for driving distances and aligns with the company's goals of increasing market share.
