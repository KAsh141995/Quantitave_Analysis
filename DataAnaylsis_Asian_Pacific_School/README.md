# Analysis for  Asian Pacific Business School
### The global pursuit of a business education has become a trend, with an increasing number of Asians opting for the Master of Business Administration (MBA) path to attain corporate success, as revealed by a recent survey. This surge is reflected in the growing applicant pool for MBA courses at Asia-Pacific schools. Across the region, thousands of individuals from Asia are demonstrating a heightened willingness to temporarily pause their careers and dedicate two years to acquiring a theoretical business qualification.

### The programs offered by these schools are renowned for their rigor, encompassing diverse subjects such as economics, banking, marketing, behavioral sciences, labor relations, decision-making, strategic thinking, business law, and more. The dataset, data.csv, sheds light on some key characteristics of the leading business schools in the Asia-Pacific region.

#### To address this, I've conducted an analysis covering the following aspects:

- **Descriptive Statistics** : A comprehensive summary, including mean, median, standard deviation, variance, range, minimum, and maximum, has been compiled for each quantitative variable in the dataset. This information is presented in a table, offering insights into the characteristics of Asia-Pacific business schools.

- **Comparative Summaries**: 
  - **Local and Foreign Tuition Costs**: An exploration of any differences between local and foreign tuition costs.
  - **Mean Starting Salaries**: A comparison between schools that require work experience and those that do not.
  - **Mean Starting Salaries**: An examination of mean starting salaries for schools with and without English test requirements.

- **Relationships between Starting Salaries and Tuition**: The analysis investigates whether starting salaries exhibit any correlation with local and foreign tuition costs, supported by visual and numerical measures.

- **Boxplot for Starting Salaries**: A graphical representation of starting salaries is provided through a boxplot, highlighting the first, second, and third quartiles. The presence of outliers is also identified and discussed.
