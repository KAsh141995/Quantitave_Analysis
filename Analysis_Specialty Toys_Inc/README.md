# Analysis for Speciality Toy Inc.
### Specialty Toys, Inc. specializes in offering a diverse range of innovative children's toys. Recognizing the preholiday season as the optimal time to unveil new products, the company strategically introduces them in October to cater to families seeking fresh ideas for December holiday gifts. To ensure timely availability, Specialty places one-time orders with manufacturers in June or July each year. The unpredictable demand for children's toys presents a challenge, as successful toys can generate substantial profits, while unsuccessful ones can result in excess inventory and reduced prices.

### The impending introduction of a new product, Weather Teddy, prompts critical decisions on order quantities. This Taiwanese-made talking teddy bear predicts weather conditions when its hand is pressed, offering responses ranging from upbeat forecasts to rain predictions. Despite not being a perfect predictor, tests indicate surprisingly accurate results. The management team proposes order quantities of 15,000, 18,000, 24,000, or 28,000 units, reflecting uncertainty about the market potential.

#### Addressing these issues, I conducted an analysis that covers:

- **Demand Distribution** : Using the sales forecaster's prediction, I described a normal probability distribution, sketched it, and highlighted its mean and standard deviation.

- **Stockout Probabilities**: Calculated the probability of a stockout for the suggested order quantities.

- **Profit Projections**: Computed projected profits for the suggested order quantities under three scenarios: worst case (sales=15,000 units), most likely case (sales=18,000 units), and best case (sales=28,000 units).

- **Manager's Policy** : Analyzed the manager's suggestion of a 70% chance of meeting demand and a 30% chance of stockouts, determining the order quantity and projecting profits under the three sales scenarios.

Recommendation: Provided my own order quantity recommendation along with associated profit projections, offering a rationale for the recommendation.

Specialty Toys expects to sell Weather Teddy for $24 with a $16 cost per unit, planning to sell surplus inventory for $5 per unit after the holiday season. The sales forecaster predicts an expected demand of 20,000 units with a 95% probability of demand falling between 10,000 and 30,000 units.
